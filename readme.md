I had an issue with Digital Ocean where all of my past projects are not displaying properly so I created another droplet, but it didn't seem to fix the issue. I have submitted a support ticket.

## Project Description

This is a simple to-do list that doesn't require user sign up. It has the basic CRUD function for users to add, read, update and delete tasks as they wish. I have tried to use email authentication, but I couldn't get mailgun to send the confirmation email so I decided this might be a better way with a clean UI and better UX.
